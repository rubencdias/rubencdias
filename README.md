Hi, I’m Rúben C. Dias, a portuguese composer currently studying composition in ESMAE, Porto. I'm now interested in how music interacts with pre-recorded image and how electronic devices and instruments shape the way we make music and how to integrate that in a audivisual way.
I'm currently learning BELA, a interface for audio synthesis and interaction.
